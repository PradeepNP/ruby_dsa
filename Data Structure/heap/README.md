# Heap
In computer science, a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure which is essentially an almost complete tree that satisfies the heap property: in a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C. In a min heap, the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C The node at the "top" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.

Generally Heap can be in two types:
1. Max Heap - The root node must be greater than its children
2. Min Heap - The root node must be smaller than its children

# Application of Heap DS
Heap Data Structure is originated by Heapsort. But, generally the quick sort is better than Heapsort. Nevertheless, the Heapsort Data Structure has it own application. One of them is Priority Queue, because it supports insert(), delete(), max(), descreasekey() function in O(log n). Binominal Heap and Fibonacci Heap are the variation of Binary Heap.
